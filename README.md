## ShadowFox AI/ML Internship - Beginner Level Task 1: Image Tagging with TensorFlow

This repository implements a basic image tagging model using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model is trained to classify images of clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset into categories like "T-shirt/top," "Dress," or "Sneaker."

**Key Steps:**

* **Data Preparation:** Loads the Fashion MNIST dataset.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Normalizes pixel values between 0 and 1.
* **Model Architecture:** Defines a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with convolutional, pooling, flattening, and dense layers.
* **Model Training:** Trains the CNN model on the training data for a specified number of epochs.
* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the model's accuracy on the testing data.
* **Model Deployment:** Saves the trained model for future use (optional, not implemented in this example).
* **Visualization:** Plots sample test images with their predicted and true labels.

**Code Dependencies:**

* TensorFlow
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

**Instructions:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib`.
3. Run the script (`python main.py`) to train and evaluate the model. 
4. The script also generates a visualization of sample test images and their classifications.

**Further Exploration:**

* Experiment with different CNN architectures (number of layers, filters, etc.)
* Explore data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
* Implement hyperparameter tuning to optimize training.
* Deploy the model to a web application for real-world image tagging.

This is a basic example to showcase the power of TensorFlow and image classification. With further exploration and customization, you can build more robust and versatile image tagging models for various applications.
